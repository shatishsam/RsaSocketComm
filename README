Client and Server based socket communicaion with RSA encryption

Instructions to build in linux
1.) install openssl:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libssl-dev

2.) Build server seperately
g++ -o server server.cpp rsa_utils.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -w

3.) Build client seperately
g++ -o client client.cpp rsa_utils.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -w

Algorith for server:
1.) Bind server and listen for clients
2.) When client is connected send public key and accept clients public key
3.) start receive and send threads to send and receive messages parallely
4.) encrypt message with clients public key before sending
5.) decrypt message with servers private key when receiving messages

Algorith for client:
1.) Connect to server with given ipaddress
2.) When server is connected accept server public key and send public key. 
3.) start receive and send threads to send and receive messages parallely
4.) encrypt message with servers public key before sending
5.) decrypt message with clients private key when receiving messages
